        "Unfortunately someone vandalized my car door and so my key wasn't working. I didn't have the remote either so I was basically locked out of my own car. I called Eagle Locksmith and they dispatched David to me within 20 minutes of calling. David was able to open my door, make me a new remote, and he also made me an extra key. Eagle Locksmith is a great company and David is an amazing locksmith who saved me in the middle of the night. The price was fair and I didn't get charged for the extra key. Thank you to Eagle Locksmith!",

        "My experience with Eagle Locksmith was outstanding from start to finish. I needed to upgrade the locks on my business after a break-in, and they came through with high-quality products and expert installation. The technician even walked me through how the new system worked and made sure everything was perfect before leaving. The team clearly knows what they’re doing and genuinely cares about their customers. I feel much safer now. Thank you!",
